How to use?

1. Create a content type called Name: "Featured", type: 'featured'
2. Go to admin/settings/content_slider
3. Enter the content type 'featured' in the source for block 1
4. Go to admin/build/block and place the block: 'Content Slider 1' anwhere you like.

The script enlists the help of the jQuery library for its engine.

Sponsors:
---------

Thanks to Faber John of Af83.com to have sponsered the custom slider that supports preconfigured images, theming, automatically creates a content type when the module is installed and also supports embedded videos. This module has been used here: http://www.cirm.ca.gov/ and would play like this out of the box when installed.
