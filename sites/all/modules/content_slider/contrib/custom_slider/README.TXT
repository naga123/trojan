This is a contrib module developed by Ebizon Technologies (www.ebizontek.com). Email: info@ebizontek.com.

Featured Content Slider Custom:
-------------------------------

This contrib module has dependencies on image, imagecache, emfield, emvideo. It automatically creates a new content type "Featured content slider" called eb_custom_slider when the module is installed. The slider is preconfigured to work with videos, properly configured images and generated thumnails and work like the slider here: http://www.cirm.ca.gov/.  

Installation of the module automatically creates the block which can be put anywhere you want. The content type "Featured content slider" would allow for the user to enter the content.

Other settings can be configured from: admin/settings/eb_custom_slider.

The view can be further themed by changing node-eb_custom_slider.tpl.php in the module.


Sponsors:
---------

Thanks to Faber John of Af83.com to have sponsered the custom slider that supports preconfigured images, theming, automatically creates a content type when the module is installed and also supports embedded videos. This slider looks like the slider on: http://www.cirm.ca.gov/ and would work like this out of the box when installed.
