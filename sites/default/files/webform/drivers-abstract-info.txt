I'm owner of international driving licence with eligibility to drive motorcycles and vehicles 
up to 3,5 tons across whole world. Due to this fact I'm unable to provide Canadian driver's abstract.
I have 7 years without single accident. In case of need I'm able to change my international
DL for a Canadian one.

Thank you for your understanding
